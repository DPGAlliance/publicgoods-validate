# Digital Public Goods Validation Form

The [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) is now crowdsourcing reviews of digital public goods! Weâ€™re asking you to participate by reviewing open source projects against the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard) with the ultimate goal of determining if a project qualifies as a Digital Public Good.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

Open source represents an unprecedented opportunity to fundamentally alter power balances in international development. But, we canâ€™t harness that power without the cooperation of many - reviewers, maintainers, creators, policy makers, and so many others (that means you! ðŸ‘Š).

This community sourcing exercise will give you the opportunity to delve into some of the largest up and coming open source projects. Youâ€™ll get a chance to understand their licenses and documentation, and how theyâ€™re designing for best practices, standards, privacy and more.

By participating, youâ€™ll get a better understanding of open projects that are making a difference in the world, particularly those that are advancing practical solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Youâ€™ll also join a growing number of innovators working on technology for development (T4D).

## ðŸŽ® App

The app is live at https://validate.digitalpublicgoods.net for anyone to contribute!
